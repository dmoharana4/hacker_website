<p>Gray hats fall into the middle ground between these two other hacker categories. Gray hats sell or disclose their zero-day vulnerabilities not to criminals, but to governmentsâ€”law enforcement agencies, intelligence agencies or militaries. The governments then use those security holes to hack into the systems of adversaries or criminal suspects. Gray hats can be individual hackers or researchers who uncover flaws on their own, defense contractors who have hacking divisions tasked specifically with uncovering flaws for a government to use, or boutique broker firms like Vupen and Zerodium, two French companies who are in the business of finding or brokering the sale of zero-days to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>
